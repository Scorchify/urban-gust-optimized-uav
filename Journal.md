## 5/19: Set up Notion HQ databases and layout - Julian
Set up the project on Notion page, sharing permissions with Ayden, and linking important documents to the main page. Additionally, I created a work log system to easily track the tasks we're completing. <br>

## 5/24: Set up Notion BOM Page and Drafted BOM - Julian and Ayden
Met up in real life to create the Notion BOM page and draft a full BOM for our drone. We also used some time to fully decide on an area of focus (environmental improvement). We researched viable battery, motor, and flight controller + ESC stacks to pick the best combination of electronics for our desired design. Julian and I also did research into what computing unit we wanted to use for the autonomous functions of the drone, ultimately deciding on the Hailo 8 AI Hat + Raspberry Pi 5 over the Jetson Nano for budgetary reasons. We used websites like oscarliang.com and other FPV sites to get recommmendations for the best electronics to buy for power effeciency, companion computer features, and wiring complexity while staying within a reasonable budget. <br>

## 5/26: Set up a notion page to host our lucidchart diagrams and started wiring diagram - Ayden
I signed up for lucidchart and created a Notion page to host our lucidchart digarams with the intent that we would be using lucidchart for our software control flow diagrams in the near future. Additionally, I started working on the wiring diagram, where I mainly imported the image files of the parts I needed to include. I also set up a NoodleTools research project to centralize our research and simplify APA exporting. <br>

## 5/27: Worked on wiring diagram and CAD - Julian and Ayden
Julian and I met today on discord to work on the wiring diagram and frame CAD. Julian has made good progress with the master sketch and drone arm CAD while I have almost finished the wiring diagram, only missing UART connections to the Receiver, Raspberry Pi 5, and M10 MicroGPS from the Flight Controller. Tomorrow we're hoping to finish the wiring diagram and continue to make CAD progress. <br> <br>

## 5/28: Finished wiring diagram and re-designed the CAD of the drone – Julian and Ayden

After I quickly finished the wiring diagram, Julian designed the Pi Camera Mounting System, developing two different versions. Additionally, we decided that a redesign of the drone's frame was in order, as the Lipo Batteries would not fit on the bottom stage of the central hub. Julian changed the master sketch to fix the issue. I also spent a lot of time transferring our Notion worklog to a GitHub Journal. Tomorrow, we're hoping to continue progressing on the CAD and start researching what Python libraries we are going to have to learn for the project.
